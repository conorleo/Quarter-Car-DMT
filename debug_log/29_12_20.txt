Debug Log - Simscape - 29.12.20

Aim: Fix error1 = 'sim stopped due to singularity in ____ joint.'

17:41 - change consistency tolearance from 1e-6 to 1e-3 in solver config block
	Different error (error2 = 'sim stopped after___s')
17:42 - change consistency tolearance from 1e-3 to 1e-4 in solver config block
	Original error (error1)
17:43 - change consistency tolearance from 1e-4 to 5e-4 in solver config block
	error2
17:45 - change consistency tolearance from 5e-4 to 3e-4 in solver config block
	error1
17:46 - change consistency tolearance from 3e-4 to 4e-4 in solver config block
	error2
17:47 - change consistency tolearance from 4e-4 to 3.5e-4 in solver config block
	error1
17:55 - change consistency tolearance from 3.5e-4 to 1e-1 in solver config block
	works for all frequencies!
17:57 - change consistency tolearance from 1e-1 to 1e-2 in solver config block
	error2
17:59 - tick 'start from equilibirium' in solver config block on 0 Hz to see if intial oscillations are removed
	vibrations damped after 0.8s (no difference to normal)
18:16 - solver struggles to last long durations at higher frequencies

18:17 - Adapted paramertise_kine_model to wait 1.2s before running at every frequency
	All vibrations gone before start hence it works.
18:24 - Log damper position, x_damp to workspace with scope off l_damper.

18:28 - Log sprung mass position and velocity

18:31 - Units of sprung mass and damper signals converted to appropriate
